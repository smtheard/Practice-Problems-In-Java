# Practice Problems
This repository will contain a folder for each interview question I can find and provide a solution for. Inside the folder will be a problem.md with the requirements and a solution.java with the solution to the problem. Feel free to fork this and use it to study as well.

I am using ST2 and Java7.

In progress:
